// space complexity--:
// represents the relationship btwn amount of memory taken by an algo including the memory needed for input(for general space complexity) as the input size increases.
// auxilliary space complexity- memory required for the algo excluding memory required for input.->in general we talk abt this only
// THUMB RULES FOR SPACE COMP-:

// 1) Most primitives(boolean,numbers,undefined,null) are constant space.
// 2)string requires O(n) space where n is str length.
// 3)reference types are generally O(n) where n is the length of array or number of key.
